This week i was working on setting up the vnc server. I had lxde operating system on my raspberry pi which being a light version didn't had many features availble, also it has less interfaces compared to the regular os. Therefore, i switched to remote desktop connection and it worked fine.
Also i had a problem while retreving the address. I got 0x44 which was wrong and then after searching a bit i figured out that it has two addresses. TO fix it i connected vin to adr and then it worked for me.
